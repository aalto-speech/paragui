Stuff that needs to be done and wishlist:

These are in no particular order. A 1.0 release is reliant on doing most of
 this stuff. Some might be dupes, some might be done already.

- Include the Visual Studio.NET project file in CVS directly.
- Favor archivers that have the same extension as an archive when opening.
- Deal with Unix platforms without POSIX threads (NetBSD, etc).
- Other archivers: perhaps tar(.gz|.bz2), RPM, ARJ, etc. These are less
  important, since streaming archives aren't of much value to games (which
  is why zipfiles are king: random access), but it could have uses for, say,
  an installer/updater. I thought it might be neat to have MBOX and Maildir
  support so that both "archives" look identical to an application; might be
  nice for an email program. That's blue sky, unless someone wants to tackle
  it.
- Platforms to be verified as working: Solaris, WinNT 3.1, WinME, WinXP,
  MacOS 8.1
- Platforms to port to: NetBSD (needs pthreads), OS/2 (needs platform driver),
  PocketPC (Maybe can just use win32.c?), Amiga (needs platform driver),
  AtheOS (needs platform driver, maybe can use unix.c and posix.c?)
- Use __cdecl in physfs.h?
- Look for FIXMEs (many marked with "!!!" in comments).
- Probably other stuff. Requests and recommendations are welcome.
