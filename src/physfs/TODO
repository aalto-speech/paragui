- update the Makefile so that Cygwin can generate a DLL. The entire codebase
  compiles under Cygwin otherwise.
- Hmm...we can determine the actual CD-ROM drives under Win32, but how do you
  decide that there's no disc in the drive?
- MacOS support.
- Move the integer types to something abstract. uint32, etc.
- Ditch the "standard" i/o routines (fopen() and friends) and move this into
  the platform drivers.

// end of TODO ...
