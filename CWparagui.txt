Code Warrior 7 Projects for Windows and Mac (05/31/2002)

	I am not sure if these will work with earlier versions of CW,
but you can try, the only reason that they may not is if some of the 
OS libs don't exist.

	Now to use the project files........

	Unzip into the man branch of paragui you are using. You will 
find the project file to load with CW in the CWProject directory.
In order to completly compile the paragui lib, you DON'T have to compile
in the external libs like with VC++. You only need to link in the libs 
when you compile your actual program. 

	Currently the project files only compile static versions of paragui,
but hopefully soon there will be dynamically linkable versions.

	Any external includes (SDL, freetype, SDL_image, expat, physFS) must
be loacted in the CWProjects\external dir. You're free to change the access
paths to were you have these files if you know how.....just remember to remove
the {project}\external access path from the access paths or you will get
multiple defines.

	Also, please note that when compiling the paragui lib on either MAC
or windows, the PG_color.cpp will appear to freeze.....it doesn't, it takes 
about 5 minutes to compile on my AMD 950.

	Have fun, I hope I covered everything here....O one more thing, any
external libs MUST also be compiled from CW in order to link them with any
other CW project, including this one.  :)
