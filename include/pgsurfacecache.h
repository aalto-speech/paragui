/** @short A class for caching SDL_Surface images.
    
    To reduce memory consumption, paragui classes use this class to cache
    their surfaces. The class stores an internal counter for each surface that
    is decreased every time the surface is deleted. It is proposed to use this
    interface if you add a new class to ParaGui.

	  This function has the task of creating a unique key to a given
	  surface. This is done by simply writing all parameters one after
	  the other, but the implementation may change in future versions.
	  Therefore, the parameters are not really neccessary. However, to ensure
	  that the created keys are unique, you should use the parameters.

	    different from the surface in the cache, your surface will be quietly
	    deleted. So NEVER touch a surface again after you have added it to the
	    cache. ALWAYS use the returned pointer instead.

	    This behaviour has a slight drawback if you add a surface the
