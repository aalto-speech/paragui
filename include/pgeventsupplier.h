 @short Interface for classes that supply SDL_Events to Paragui
 
        Paragui works with SDL_Events to obtain input and operating system events. Instead of getting them directly 
        from SDL it uses this interface, allowing the application to preprocess SDL_events or obtain them from an 
        application specific event source.
