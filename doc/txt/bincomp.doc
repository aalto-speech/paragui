\page Binary Compatibility Issues With C++

	<br>
	Binary compatibility has to be targeted for post 1.0.0 versions of ParaGUI

	Matthias Ettrich from the KDE project has written a very useful document
	that explains the do's and don'ts.

	<br>
	Here is an excerpt of the most important things:
	<br>

	<hr><br>
	<h3>The dos and don'ts </h3>

	You can ...
	<ul>

	<li> add new non-virtual functions.

	<li> reimplement virtual functions defined in one of the base classes
	<b>if</b> it is safe that programs linked with the prior version of
	the library call the implementation in the base class rather than the
	new one. <em> This is tricky and might be dangerous. Think twice
	before doing it. </em>

	<li> change an inline function or make an inline function non-inline
	<b>if</b> it is safe that programs linked with the prior version of
	the library call the old implementation. <em> This is tricky and might
	be dangerous. Think twice before doing it. </em>

	<li> Remove private non-virtual function <b>if</b> they are not called
	by any inline functions.

	<li> add new <b>static</b> data members.

	<li> add new classes.

	</ul>

	<p> You cannot ...
	<ul>

	<li> add new virtual functions as this will change the layout of the
	virtual table and thus break subclasses.

	<li> change the order of virtual functions in the class
	declaration. This will just as well change the layout of the virtual
	table.

	<li> change the signature of a function. Note that extending a
	function with another parameter, even if this parameter has a default
	argument, changes the signature and thus is <b>not</b> binary compatible
	(only source compatible). Simply add another function with the same
	name and the extended argument list and add a short BCI (binary
	incompatibiliy issue) note that the two functions shall be merged with
	a default argument in later versions of the library.

	<li> change the access rights to some functions, for example from
	<tt>private</tt> to <tt>public</tt>. With some compilers, this
	information may be part of the signature. If you need to make a
	private function protected or even public, you have to add a new
	function that calls the private one.

	<li> add new data members to a class except static ones.

	<li> change the class hierachy apart from adding new classes.

	</ul>
