Things anyone could adopt:

CLEANUP/REWRITE OF PG_COLORS
----------------------------

pgcolors.[h|cpp] are autogenerated from the "make_colors.pike" script
in the "bin" directory. I never really got acquainted with the pike
scripting language. The script should be rewritten to use a more
"common" language (e.g. Perl, Python, ...),


CONSTRUCTOR CLEANUP
-------------------

I would like to make ParaGUI "object factory" compliant. To achieve this
any class *must* have an identical constructor:

AnyPG_Class(PG_Widget* parent, const PG_Rect& r)

or even better:

AnyPG_Class(PG_Widget* parent, const PG_Rect& r = PG_Rect(0,0,0,0))

it's allowed to have more params in the constructor but these also must
have default values.

To make the change not to radical the current constructors can coexist
with the *new* constructors.


ADDING ITEMS TO (WIDGET)LISTS WITHOUT ADDWIDGET/ADDITEM
-------------------------------------------------------

The current WidgetList/ListBox implementation isn't very clean.
It should work this way:

PG_ListBox mylist(NULL, PG_Rect(...));
PG_ListBoxItem item1(&mylist, ...);
PG_ListBoxItem item2(&mylist, ...);
PG_ListBoxItem item3(&mylist, ...);
PG_ListBoxItem item4(&mylist, ...);
mylist.Show();

Currently you need to call mylist.AddItem(..) for any item to be
added.
PG_WidgetList should (must) work the same way.


DESIGN SOME WEBPAGES FOR PARAGUI
--------------------------------

If you want to help us to bring ParaGUI to a new web presence:

1) Get an account at http://savannah.nongnu.org
2) Email your account name to me (pipelka@teleweb.at),
   or any other project member.
3) Login at savannah and register your SSH public key
4) Checkout the webpages from savannah:
   http://savannah.nongnu.org/cvs/?group=paragui
5) Create new ones
6) Commit your changes :))
   "cvs -z3 commit" is your friend.
