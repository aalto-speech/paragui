ParaGUI unstable development tree
BEWARE! MAY CONTAIN NUTS
---------------------------------

----------------------
ROADMAP LEADING TO 1.2
----------------------

1.1.5 - signals handled by libsigc++
1.1.6 - API cleanup (all binary incompatible changes allowed)
1.1.7 - Performance tuning / more API cleanups
1.1.8 - unify constructors (e.g.: PG_Widget(PG_Widget* parent, const PG_Rect& rect))
        needed for factory. merge object factory from paragui2.
1.1.9 - string cleanup. (redesign of event-handling?). unify all widget constructors.
        split off XML layoutloader
1.1.10 - bug fixing and API reality check
1.1.12 - feature and API freeze
1.1.?? - i'll consult my magic orb

If you want to take part in the development process - drop me a few lines or
take a look into "TODO".


----------------------------
Whats new in ParaGUI 1.1.9 ?
----------------------------

- removed mostly all const char* types, now using const std::string&
  This is a major change and will have a massive impact on code passing NULL pointers
- performance improvements (avoiding type conversions between std::string and char*,
  preallocate static strings)
- updated PG_Colors (added C++ app for color generation)
- bumped version to 1.1.9
- fixed a problem in PG_TimerObject (Thanks Ulf)
- made PG_Widget::Show/Hide methods virtual
- fixed uninitialized values in PG_ListBoxItem
- all multiline text-rendering is now done with PG_MultiLineEdit (log, messagebox).
  This is much faster.
- added PG_Button::sigGlobalClick
- changed returntype of PG_Widget::QuitModal to bool. Signals can now be connected to it.
- support for GCC 4.0 (visibility)
- fix for PG_ScrollArea::ScrollToWidget
- added sigAreaChangedWidth, sigAreaChangedHeight to PG_ScrollWidget
- fixed a race condition in PG_TimerObject
- fixed a bug in PG_Application::Shutdown
- added devhelp support to html documentation


- applied patches from Sebastian:
- PG_ListBox: fixed GetSelectedIndex()
- PG_Widget:
    * added signals sigMouseEnter and sigMouseLeave
    * made SetChildTransparency() call SetTransparency() recursively
- PG_MultiLineEdit:
    * improved text clipping
    * fixed clipping of highlighted area
    * draw code improvements
    * code clean-up
- PG_Application:
    * clean up of ShutDown()
    * removal of redundant VC++ stuff
- replaced some Win32 macros with _MSC_VER
- re-enabled and fixed some VC++ specific warnings
- moved some member initializations of ParaGUI classes to constructor lists
- added some doc updates
- PG_Image: general clean up
- PG_ScrollWidget: a problem when applying changes - while PG_ScrollWidget is hidden (like resizing, scrolling) - has been fixed
- fixed both ParaGUI DLL export (thanks "Chris"!) and import
- PG_RichEdit: fixed text clipping regarding vertical scroll bar
- defined HAVE_STRDUP macro for VC++
- PG_PopupMenu: added DLL interface for nested class MenuItem
- replaced BKMODE_X macros with enum PG_Draw::BkMode to avoid some ambiguities (and to make it more C++ like ;))
- fixed some int to bool conversion warnings
- added default value for PG_Application::SetCaption()'s second param


- applied patches from Martin Bickel <mbickel@asc-hq.org>)
- removed SigC namespace usage in pgsingals.h
- non-const Width- and Height methods of PG_Rect are redundant
- fixed PG_LineEdit::InsertChar (insert method)
- recursive FindChild methods
- adaptive PG_Button behaviour
- the PG_Dropdown missed a function to get the item index, although the
  itemlist offered one.
- SDL Event source customization patch
- Popupmenu patch
  It adds the ability to use menuitems like "save\tctrl-s", where the ctrl-s is
  displayed at the right side. Another change is that a separator entry displays a line (it was until
  now only a little more space between two menu items). 
- fixed double deletion of DropList objects
- PGApplication:: SetBackground didn't update the screen. It now does. It
  also allows for freeing surfaces itself.
- The sliders in ScrollBars now have a proportional size. Since the
  PageSize is becoming important now, PG_MultilineEdit had to be updated
  to set it. I expect that some other classes also need to set the
  pagesize, but I haven't checked all of them yet.
- PGWidget already had properties for the inner border color for thicker
  borders, but they couldn't be set using a theme. I've changed that, the
  entries are called bordercolor0i / bordercolor1i
- PGScrollWidget initialized the scroll area with a width and height of
  0. This caused scrollbars to appear as soon as the first widget was
  added. The area size is now correctly initialized so that the
  scrollbars only appear when necessary.

Whats new in ParaGUI 1.0 RC1 (Beta3) ?
--------------------------------------

Bug fixes, bug fixes, ... :))
Cleaned up the font interface.
Some performance tweaks (see PG_Widget::SetDirtyUpdate()).
added PG_DataContainer to hold binary data.
added Python support (./configure --enable-python, refer to
the docs for a detailed description of the configuration
options )


--------------------------------------
Whats new in ParaGUI 1.0 RC0 (Beta2) ?
--------------------------------------

The really last thing i had to change was the internal
structure of the library.
The whole arrangement was also quite a mess.

Now the lib is separated into these main parts:

draw - all drawing and surface stuff
fonts - font handling and rendering
core - basic things like message handling, app class, ...
themes - the theme loader
widgets - all widget classes

I also cleaned up the header files.
Now there are only headers in the include dir that are
needed by client applications.

pgdrawobject.h has been removed - use pgdraw.h

There are also some compatiblity macros in pgdraw.h that
allow usage of some old style functions. e.g.:

#define PG_DrawLine PG_Draw::DrawLine



--------------------------------
Whats new in ParaGUI 1.0 Beta1 ?
--------------------------------

The widget system in the prior versions was quite a mess.
Now i decided to clean up the whole system and make it
more *defined*.

Due to this there are some changes in widget creation.
The following rules apply:

Now there are 2 basic widget types:

PG_Widget:
An unthemed widget that can have an internal drawing surface
or not.

PG_ThemeWidget:
A themed widget (loads it's style from the theme definition)
that can have an internal drawing surface or not.


Widgets with drawing surfaces:
-----------------------------

The  content is drawn into the surface and blitted to the
screen.

Construction with internal surface:
PG_Widget(PG_Widget* parent, const PG_Rect& rect, true);
PG_ThemeWidget(PG_Widget* parent, const PG_Rect& rect, true);

The param "true" indicates the creation of the drawing surfaces.

Redrawing & Blitting:

Redraw(bool doUpdate);
This function redraws the widget (by calling eventDraw()).
And calls Update(true) if doUpdate = true.

Update(bool doBlit);
This calls Blit() and updates the screen.

Blit();
This function blits the widget surface to the screen and
calls eventBlit() that can be used for custom blit behaviour.



Widget without drawing surfaces:
--------------------------------

The content of the widget is directly blitted to the screen.

Construction:
PG_Widget(PG_Widget* parent, const PG_Rect& rect);
PG_ThemeWidget(PG_Widget* parent, const PG_Rect& rect);

Blitting:

Update(bool doBlit);
This calls Blit() and updates the screen.

Blit();
This function blits the widget content directly to the
screen by calling eventBlit().


I hope this clarifies the widget behaviour stuff.
Please contact me if you have further suggestions and
additions.

For backward compatibility the *old* widgettypes
(PG_GradientWidget, PG_StaticFrame) still can be used but
I definitely wouldn't suggest this. Please try to port your
application to the new widgetclasses.

Porting should be quite easy by replacing PG_GradientWidget,
PG_StaticFrame with PG_ThemeWidget.


I hope this clarifies the widget behaviour stuff.
Please contact me if you have further suggestions and
additions.
