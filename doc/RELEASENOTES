Whats new in ParaGUI 1.0 RC1 (Beta3) ?
--------------------------------------

Bug fixes, bug fixes, ... :))
Cleaned up the font interface.

added PG_DataContainer to hold binary data.
added Python support (./configure --enable-python, refer to
the docs for a detailed description of the configuration
options )


--------------------------------------
Whats new in ParaGUI 1.0 RC0 (Beta2) ?
--------------------------------------

The really last thing i had to change was the internal
structure of the library.
The whole arrangement was also quite a mess.

Now the lib is separated into these main parts:

draw - all drawing and surface stuff
fonts - font handling and rendering
core - basic things like message handling, app class, ...
themes - the theme loader
widgets - all widget classes

I also cleaned up the header files.
Now there are only headers in the include dir that are
needed by client applications.

pgdrawobject.h has been removed - use pgdraw.h

There are also some compatiblity macros in pgdraw.h that
allow usage of some old style functions. e.g.:

#define PG_DrawLine PG_Draw::DrawLine



--------------------------------
Whats new in ParaGUI 1.0 Beta1 ?
--------------------------------

The widget system in the prior versions was quite a mess.
Now i decided to clean up the whole system and make it
more *defined*.

Due to this there are some changes in widget creation.
The following rules apply:

Now there are 2 basic widget types:

PG_Widget:
An unthemed widget that can have an internal drawing surface
or not.

PG_ThemeWidget:
A themed widget (loads it's style from the theme definition)
that can have an internal drawing surface or not.


Widgets with drawing surfaces:
-----------------------------

The  content is drawn into the surface and blitted to the
screen.

Construction with internal surface:
PG_Widget(PG_Widget* parent, const PG_Rect& rect, true);
PG_ThemeWidget(PG_Widget* parent, const PG_Rect& rect, true);

The param "true" indicates the creation of the drawing surfaces.

Redrawing & Blitting:

Redraw(bool doUpdate);
This function redraws the widget (by calling eventDraw()).
And calls Update(true) if doUpdate = true.

Update(bool doBlit);
This calls Blit() and updates the screen.

Blit();
This function blits the widget surface to the screen and
calls eventBlit() that can be used for custom blit behaviour.



Widget without drawing surfaces:
--------------------------------

The content of the widget is directly blitted to the screen.

Construction:
PG_Widget(PG_Widget* parent, const PG_Rect& rect);
PG_ThemeWidget(PG_Widget* parent, const PG_Rect& rect);

Blitting:

Update(bool doBlit);
This calls Blit() and updates the screen.

Blit();
This function blits the widget content directly to the
screen by calling eventBlit().


I hope this clarifies the widget behaviour stuff.
Please contact me if you have further suggestions and
additions.

For backward compatibility the *old* widgettypes
(PG_GradientWidget, PG_StaticFrame) still can be used but
I definitely wouldn't suggest this. Please try to port your
application to the new widgetclasses.

Porting should be quite easy by replacing PG_GradientWidget,
PG_StaticFrame with PG_ThemeWidget.


I hope this clarifies the widget behaviour stuff.
Please contact me if you have further suggestions and
additions.
